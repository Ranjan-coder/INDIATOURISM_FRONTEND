    <h2 className='headingtext'>Golden Triangle Tour India</h2>
    <p>India's <b>golden triangle</b> is a tourist circuit which connects the national capital <b>Delhi, Agra</b> and <b>Jaipur</b>. The Golden Triangle is so called because of the triangular shape formed by the 
        locations of New Delhi, Agra and Rajasthan on a map. But now <b>Amritsar</b> is emerging as the fourth
         angle of this triangle. The trips usually start in Delhi, moving south to the site of <b>Taj Mahal</b> 
         at Agra, then west to the desert landscapes of Rajasthan. It is normally possible to do the trip 
         by coach or private journey through most tour operators. The Golden Triangle is now a well-traveled
          route, providing a good spectrum of the country's different landscapes. The circuit is about 720 km
           by road, with each leg being about 4 to 6 hours of drive. The Shatabdi express train also connects 
           Delhi with Agra and Jaipur. Golden triangle India welcomes tourists to the best of Indian destinations, 
           which will make your journey memorable. So, if you want to taste the culture and religion of India,
