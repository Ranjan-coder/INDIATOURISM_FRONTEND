            <p><b>History</b><br/>The name Odisha refers to the current state in India. In different eras, the region and parts of the region were known by different names, and the boundaries of the region have varied over the ages. Human history in Odisha begins in the Lower Paleolithic era, as Acheulian tools dating to that period have been discovered in various places in the region.[1] The early history of Odisha can be traced back to mentions found in ancient texts like the Mahabharata, Maha Govinda Sutta, and some Puranas. In 261 BCE, Ashoka of the Mauryan dynasty conquered the region in the bloody Kalinga War, which was fought at the banks of River Daya near present-day Bhubaneswar. The resulting bloodshed and suffering of the war deeply affected Ashoka, leading him to turn into a pacifist and convert to Buddhism. He sent peace emissaries to various neighboring nations, which indirectly caused the spread of Buddhism in Asia.<br/> The region was also known to other kingdoms in the region of East Indies due to maritime trade relations.The year 1568 CE is considered a pivotal point in the region's history. In 1568 CE, the region was conquered by the armies of the Sultanate of Bengal led by the iconoclast general Kalapahad. The region lost its political identity, with following rulers acting more as tributary lords than actual kings. The Marathas gained control of the region for almost half a decade after 1751, and the British took control in 1803, dividing the region into parts of other provinces. In 1936, the province of Odisha was formed based on populations of Odia-speaking people.</p>
