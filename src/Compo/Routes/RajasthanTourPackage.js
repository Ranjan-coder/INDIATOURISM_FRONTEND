    <h2 className='headingtext'>Rajasthan Tour Package</h2>
    <p>Rajasthan tour packages bring you a complete collection of unique tour packages. After all,
         Rajasthan is not just a state, it is the pride of its bygone rulers and the joy in the voice
          of people who say 'Padharo mhare Desh'. The desire to experience the floating bubbles of 
          culture, traditions, history and its royalty never ends, but travelers can at least start from
           somewhere with our Rajasthan tour packages. Enjoy camel fairs, wildlife attractions, historic
            forts & palaces, lakes and much more. The best places to visit in Rajasthan are Jaipur, Udaipur,
             Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Mandawa, Ranakapur, Mount Abu, and Ajmer-Pushkar. There are hundreds of
              attractions and activities to enjoy.The very name of Rajasthan conjures up the image of hilltop
               fortresses, maharajas with scimitars riding the painted elephants, the exquisitely carved havelis
                and the royal hunting grounds. Our Rajasthan holiday packages are designed to offer you
                 a peek into the era where all you get to relish are opulence and artistry. These small
                  things counted together make Rajasthan one of the most popular tourist places in India.</p>
    <p>Ajmer-Pushkar: Ajmer (pronounced 'Uh-j-mare') is a popular pilgrimage center famous for its Dargah 
        Sharif-tomb of the Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti. Ajmer is also the base for
         visiting Pushkar (pronounced 'Push-cur'), a 30-minute uphill drive from Ajmer. Pushkar is a famous
          tourist destination renowned for its Hindu pilgrimage spots, flea market, and great roadside food.
           You can get some amazing pictures of Indian sadhus here.</p>
           <p><b>Bikaner</b><br/>Bikaner (pronounced 'Beeka-nair') is famous for its palaces and its intricately 
           sculptured red and yellow sandstone temples. The climate in Bikaner is characterized by extreme
            variations in temperature, so be sure to carry weather-appropriate clothing while visiting. 
            However, despite its rugged climate, it is said that Bikaner was once an oasis town used as
             a stop-over on the trade route between Central Asia and India. It's always interesting to plan
              a trip around the time of the Bikaner Camel festival, usually held in January.</p>
              <p><b>Jaipur</b><br/>
Aptly nicknamed 'The Pink City' for its peculiar affinity for pink stone buildings Jaipur is part of the famous Golden 
Triangle of cities formed with Delhi and Agra as the other two corners. A bustling capital city and 
business centre today, Jaipur still retains a royal charm that never fails to surprise. Jaipur is home to several 
stunning ancient forts. A great time to visit is during January when the annual Literary Festival is held.</p>
<p><b>Jaisalmer</b><br/>
'The Golden City' of Jaisalmer (pronounced 'Jey-sull-mare') is popular for its 12th century Jaisalmer 
Fort as well as beautiful havelis, miles of smooth yellow sand dunes, and camel safaris. Well known 
for its camel hide artefacts and the stupendous musical and dance talent of its native people,
 Jaisalmer is the very heart of the Thar Desert.</p>
 <p><b>Jodhpur</b><br/>
Jodhpur is a city with a long and captivating history. While India was still under British colonization,
 the walled city of Jodhpur had the largest land area of all Rajputana provinces. Today, it is a flourishing 
 centre of handicraft export and tourism, with tons of hotels and palace resorts. Jodhpur has contributed
  significantly to the culinary traditions of the country. We strongly recommend a visit to the famous Umaid
   Bhavan Palace to soak in some history.</p>
   <p><b>Ranthambore</b><br/>
Once a princely game conserve, the sanctuary at Ranthambore (pronounced 'Run-thum-bore') is home to the
 beautiful Indian tiger. Ranthambore national Park is open from October to may every year. You will also 
 get a chance to see an abandoned fortress and lake and take pictures of the gazillion monkeys that are oddly
  human in their behaviour. Don't miss a chance to visit the majestic nahargarh Palace Hotel run by the very
   hospitable royal family there. It's gorgeous, especially at night. Katy Perry had her much publicised 
   royal wedding there.</p>
   <p><b>Udaipur</b><br/>
Udaipur is known as the 'City of Lakes' in view of the 8 prominent lakes within its limits.
 The Lake Palace Hotel in the middle of Lake Pichola is a spectacular sight especially when lit up at night. 
 Other big tourist attractions include the 'Shilpgram Fair' which is a craftsmen's village showcasing ethnic 
 craft, art & culture and the 'City Palace' with its various towers, domes, arches and courtyards. 
 The live cultural show at 'Bagore ki Haveli' is worth a visit. Udaipur has been used as a backdrop for 
 lots of movies including the James Bond flick 'Octopussy.</p>
 <p><b>Mount Abu</b><br/> Rajasthan has a hill station, and it is like a breath of fresh air in the midst of all 
    that desert aridity. Mount Abu was once the summer capital of Maharajas. Today, it makes for a fine 
    holiday destination, situated as it is on a hill. The place also holds special religious importance 
    for Jains. Boating in Lake Nakki, visiting Dhrudhiya waterfalls, and exploring the lush Mount 
    Abu Wildlife Sanctuary are just some of the attractions here. The most famous one is the Dilwara
     Jain Temple.</p>
     <p><b>Chittorgarh</b><br/> Chittorgarh is a town not too far from Udaipur. It has a glorious past with some of 
        the most valiant Rajasthani rulers, from Rawal Ratan Singh of Chittor to Samar Singh, who became
         one of the topmost allies of Prithviraj Chauhan's army. The revered Queen Padmavati, who was as
          beautiful as she was brave, is also credited to this land. Today, Chittorgarh is home to many forts,
           ruins, and temples, making it a historian's paradise. A 1-2 day trip is a must to Chittorgarh when
            you are visiting Udaipur.</p>
