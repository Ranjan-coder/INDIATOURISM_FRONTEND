                    <h2 className='headingtext'>Kerala Tour Package</h2>
                    <p>Kerala, a state situated on the tropical Malabar Coast of southwestern India,
                        is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country. Named as one of the ten
                        paradises of the world by National Geographic Traveler, Kerala is famous especially for
                        its ecotourism initiatives and beautiful backwaters. Its unique culture and traditions,
                        coupled with its varied demography, have made Kerala one of the most popular tourist
                        destinations in the world. Growing at a rate of 13.31%, the tourism industry is a major
                        contributor to the state's economy. Until the early 1980s, Kerala was a relatively unknown
                        destination, with most tourism circuits concentrated around the north of the country.
                        Aggressive marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation-the
                        government agency that oversees tourism prospects of the state-laid the foundation for the
                        growth of the tourism industry. In the decades that followed, Kerala Tourism was able to
                        transform itself into one of the niche holiday destinations in India. The tag line Kerala
                        God's Own Country was adopted in its tourism promotions and became a global superbrand.
                        Kerala is regarded as one of the destinations with the highest brand recall. In 2010,
                        Kerala attracted 660,000 foreign tourist arrivals.</p>
                    <p><b>History</b><br />The history of Kerala, India, dates back many millennia. Stone Age carvings
                        in the Edakkal Caves feature pictorial writings believed to date to at least the Neolithic era
                        around 5,000 BC, indicating the presence of a prehistoric civilization or settlement in this
                        region. From as early as 3000 BC, Chera nadu, currently known as Kerala had established
                        itself as a major spice trade center. Keralam, the then Chera nadu had direct contact
                        across the Arabian Sea with all the major Mediterranean and Red Sea ports as well
                        those of the Far East. The spice trade between Kerala and much of the world was one
                        of the main drivers of the world economy. For much of history, ports in Kerala were
                        the busiest (Muziris) among all trade and travel routes in the history of the world.</p>
                    <p><b>Fairs & Festivals</b><br />
                        Kerala with its beautiful landscapes has more than enough reason to celebrate.
                        And the varied culture of the state has given expression to a colorful mosaic of festivals and fairs.
                        The spirit of celebration is very much a part of the ethos of the state of Kerala and for visitors to
                        this state, its fairs and festivals are a must-see event to be included in their travel.</p>
                    <p><b>Best Time to Visit Kerala:</b><br /> Kerala has two rainy seasons. One with the rest of the country
                        and one in the winters and spring. While summers make the state too hot for comfort, the main monsoons
                        leave no day wet with water. The monsoons can be an amalgamation of festivals, beautiful scenic views
                        and the much talked about Ayurveda treatments. The backwaters would be flowing with monsoon water, and
                        the temperatures would be down to enjoy the view to the fullest.</p>
                    <p><b>How to Reach:</b></p>
                    <p><b>BY AIR -</b> Kerala has 2 international airports - in Thiruvananthapuram and in Kochi while the domestic
                        airport in Kozhikode is also strategically located. Flights of all the public and private airlines fly
                        between these airports and link them to the main airports in India as well as abroad.</p>
                    <p><b>BY RAIL -</b> Kerala has more than 200 railway stations, connecting various major cities as
                        well as small towns of the state. Direct trains to various destinations in Kerala can be availed
                        from major Indian cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, and Kolkata, among others.
                        Superfast and express trains such as Rajdhani and Duronto connect the larger junctions, whereas mail
                        and passenger trains are also easily available. Kerala's railway network runs from Kasargod,
                        a northwestern point of the state, to the southwestern Thiruvananthapuram.</p>
                    <p><b>BY ROAD -</b> You can reach Kerala from any part of the country using national Highways 17, 47 and 49.
                        Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are directly linked to Kerala through a good network of roads.
                        Many important cities fall on the way.</p>
