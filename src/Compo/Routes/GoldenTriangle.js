        <p>India's golden triangle is a tourist circuit which connects the national capital Delhi, Agra and Jaipur. The Golden Triangle is so called because of the triangular shape formed by the locations of New Delhi, Agra and Rajasthan on a map. But now Amritsar is emerging as the fourth angle of this triangle. The trips usually start in Delhi, moving south to the site of Taj Mahal at Agra, then west to the desert landscapes of Rajasthan. It is normally possible to do the trip by coach or private journey through most tour operators. The Golden Triangle is now a well-traveled route, providing a good spectrum of the country's different landscapes. The circuit is about 720 km by road, with each leg being about 4 to 6 hours of drive. The Shatabdi express train also connects Delhi with Agra and Jaipur.
