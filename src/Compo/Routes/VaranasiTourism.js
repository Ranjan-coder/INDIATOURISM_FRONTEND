                    <p>Varanasi, known to be the city of lights, is a district situated in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Spread over an area of 73.90 sq.kms, with an approximate population of 36, 82194, the city is known by many names. Banaras, as it is most commonly called, was officially renamed as Varanasi in 1956. It was first known as Kashi, the city of light, when it was the capital of the kingdom of the same name about 500 B.C. for over 2000 years. Banaras, the eternal city, has been the religious capital of India. Built on the banks of the sacred Ganga, it is said to combine the virtues of all other places of pilgrimage, and anyone who ends his earthly cycle here is said to be transported straight to heaven. Banaras was also celebrated as the place where the most profound wisdom dwelt, the seat of all enlightenment and learning. Its permanent advantages include the highest sanctity, fertile soil, and its location on a great river.</p>

                    <p>Hindu rulers built great palaces, temples and ghats in the city. It is one of the oldest living cities in the world and the ultimate pilgrimage for Hindus who believe that to die in the city is to attain instant salvation. Situated on the bank of Ganga, Varanasi is the tract of holy land lying between the river Varuna and Assi, which flow into the Ganga. It derives its name from these two streams. It is also mentioned in late Vedic literature and in the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. The city encompasses Sarnath, where Buddha preached his first sermon in about 530 B.C. Since one of the twelve 'Jyotirlinga' is installed here, it is believed to be the greatest 'Tirth' or crossing place between the earth and heaven. For a Hindu, to visit Varanasi and bathe in the water of the Ganga is said to be cleansed of the sins of the thousand of past rebirths. The combination of Kashi, the holy city, Ganga the celestial river and Shiva, the supreme god, makes Varanasi an immortal place on the earth. Varanasi has been a great cultural centre, especially in the field of music, learning and the craft of weaving. Some of the most renowned exponents of music have drawn their inspiration from Varanasi. Banaras brocades are treasured textiles and considered as collector's items.</p>
                    <p><b>Tourist Attractions in Varanasi:</b>
                    The Ghats of Varanasi: In this ancient city of pilgrimage, the bathing ghats are the main attraction.

                    <p><b>The Kashi Vishwanath Temple:</b> This temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is popularly known as the golden temple due to the Gold plating done on its 15.5-meter high spire. One tonne of gold donated by Maharaja Ranjit Singh has been used in the gold plating of the spire. The temple was destroyed in the various invasions and was rebuilt in 1776 by Rani Ahilyabai of Indore.</p>
                    <p><b>St. Mary's Church:</b> Situated in the cantonment area of Benaras (Varanasi), the St. Mary's Church has a low tower, spire, and projecting portico. Instead of windows, the church has louvred doors to the sides and hooded ventilation slots beneath the cornice.</p>
                    <p><b>Durga Temple:</b> Built in the 8th century, the Durga temple is one of the most important temples in Varanasi. This temple is built in the Nagara style, and the shikhara of the temple is formed by many small spires which are built one on top of the other.</p>
                    <p><b>Bharat Mata Temple:</b> This temple is dedicated to Mother India and is located just one kilometer from the Varanasi station. The temple is built in the Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapeeth, which was built by Babu Shiv Prasad Gupt. This temple was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi in 1936 so that the citizens could respect Mother India in statue form. The statue is built in marble and is a replica of undivided India in three dimensions, which has the mountains, plains, and oceans in right proportion.</p>
                    <p><b>Tulsi Manas Temple:</b> This temple is dedicated to Lord Rama and is built in the place where Goswami Tulsidas composed the epic 'Ramacharitamanas,' which provides us with a detailed description of the history and deeds of Lord Rama. Tulsi Manas Temple was constructed by a philanthropist family in 1964.</p>
                    <p><b>Nepali Temple:</b> The King of Nepal had built this temple on Lalita Ghat in the Nepali style. The Nepali temple is also called the 'Kathwala temple.'

                    <p>The workers who carved this temple were brought from Nepal, and the wood used in the temple is also found in Nepal. The specialty of this wood is that termites do not eat this wood.</p>
