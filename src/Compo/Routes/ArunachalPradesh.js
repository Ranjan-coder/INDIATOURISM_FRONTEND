            <h2 className='headingtext'>Arunachal Pradesh Tourism</h2>
            <p>Arunachal Pradesh, located in north eastern India, is known as the "Land of the Rising Sun". The literary meaning of this phrase is "the land of the dawn lit mountains." The state has its capital in Itanagar, which is also its largest city. Arunachal Pradesh is known for its natural beauty and is backed by a strong agricultural economy, with pulses, sugarcane, rice, wheat, and maize being its main crops. The state also has a considerable amount of forest cover, which ensures that forest products contribute to its economy. However, the tourism sector of the state has not been fully utilized.</p>
            <p><b>History</b><br/>The history of pre-modern Arunachal Pradesh is unclear. According to the Arunachal Pradesh government, the Hindu texts Mahabharata mention the region as the Prabhu Mountains of the Puranas, and where sage Parashurama washed away sins, the sage Vyasa meditated, King Bhishmaka founded his kingdom, and Lord Krishna married his consort Rukmini. On the other hand, the Kalika Purana written in the 10th century mentions the region to be ruled by the descendants of a king named Bhirmuko of the Chutika (today's Chutia) clan. Recorded history only became available in the Chutiya chronicles. The Monpa and Sherdukpen do keep historical records of the existence of local chiefdoms in the northwest as well. Northwestern parts of this area came under the control of the Monpa kingdom of Monyul, which flourished between 500 B.C. and 600 A.D. The remaining parts of the state, especially those bordering Myanmar, were under the control of the Chutiya Kings. However, most Arunachali tribes remained in practice largely autonomous up until Indian independence and the formalisation of indigenous administration in 1947. Recent excavations of ruins of Hindu temples, such as the 14th century Malinithan at the foot of the Siang hills in West Siang, indicate they were built during the Chutiya reign. Another notable heritage site, Bhismaknagar (built in 8th century), has led to suggestions that the Chutiya people had an advanced culture and administration in prehistoric times. The third heritage site, the 400-year-old Tawang Monastery in the extreme north-west of the state, provides some historical evidence of the Buddhist tribal people. The sixth Dalai Lama Tsangyang Gyatso was born in Tawang.</p>
            <p><b>Fairs & Festivals</b><br/>Fairs and festivals in Arunachal Pradesh are a fine way to understand the state's rich culture and traditional practices. They are an extension of the lives of the people of the state and are characterized by a lot of color. There are festivals with religious undertones as well as merry affairs, and many of them are closely linked to agriculture, the main occupation of the state. These festivals are celebrated on a grand scale and are characterized by prayers that are later followed by merry making. Among the most popular festivals of Arunachal Pradesh are Ziro Festival of Music, Losar Festival, Tamladu Festival, and Sangken Festival.</p>
            <p><b>Best Time To Visit</b><br/>Arunachal Pradesh is located at a high altitude and has pleasant weather throughout the year. However, not all activities may be available at all times, so it is advisable to cross-check the availability and seasons for each site or activity. The most preferable months to plan your trip to Arunachal Pradesh are from October to April when the weather is pleasant, and you can move around happily under the clear blue sky to have the most fun. It is recommended to avoid June to September when the rains come down hard, and it becomes a bit tough for tourists to travel in the state.</p>

It is a holy place of worship visited by a huge number of visitors and pilgrims every year. According to legend, on the way to Dwarka from Bhismaknagar, Lord Krishna with his newly married wife Rukmini Devi begged blessings of Goddess Parvati. Devi Parvati greeted the newly married couple with a garland. The stringing of the garland was so unique that overwhelmed Krishna called Devi Parvati as "Sucharu Malini," or a lady who strings garlands beautifully, and hence, the name Malinithan was achieved. The nearest airport from Malinithan is Leelabari or Dibrugarh in Assam. A helipad is also situated at Along. From here, one can take a bus to Malinithan. By bus or car, one can easily reach Malinithan from Guwahati or Itanagar.</p>
