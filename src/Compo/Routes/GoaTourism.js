            <h2 className='headingtext'>Goa Tourism</h2>
            <p>The state of Goa, in India, is famous for its beaches and places of worship, and tourism is its primary industry. Tourism is generally focused on the coastal areas of Goa, with decreased tourist activity inland. Foreign tourists, mostly from Europe, arrive in Goa in winter whilst the summer and monsoon seasons see a large number of Indian tourists. Goa handled 2.29% of all foreign tourist arrivals in the country in 2011. This relatively small state is situated on the western coast of India, between the borders of Maharashtra and Karnataka and is better known to the world as a former Portuguese enclave on Indian soil. Tourism is said to be the backbone of Goa's economy.</p>
            <p><b>History</b><br/>The history of Goa dates back to prehistoric times, though the present-day state of Goa was only established as recently as 1987. In spite of being India's smallest state by area, Goa's history is both long and diverse. It shares a lot of similarities with Indian history, especially with regard to colonial influences and a multi-cultural aesthetic. Situated on the Konkan Coast in Western India, Goa was, at various points in its history, one of the major trade centers in India. It attracted influential dynasties, seafarers, merchants, traders, monks and missionaries since its earliest known history. Throughout its history, Goa has undergone continual transformation, leaving an indelible impression on various aspects of its cultural and socio-economic development. </p>
