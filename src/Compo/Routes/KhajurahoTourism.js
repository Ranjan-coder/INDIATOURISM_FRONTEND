                    <p>The Khajuraho Group of Monuments is a group of Hindu and Jain temples located in Chhatarpur, Madhya Pradesh, India, about 175 kilometres (109 mi) southeast of Jhansi. They are one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India and are famous for their nagara-style architectural symbolism and erotic sculptures. The majority of the Khajuraho temples were built between 950 and 1050 by the Chandela dynasty. Historical records indicate that the Khajuraho temple site had 85 temples by the 12th century, spread over 20 square kilometers, but only about 25 temples have survived, spread over 6 square kilometers. Of the surviving temples, the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple is particularly notable for its profusion of sculptures with intricate details, symbolism, and expressiveness of ancient Indian art. The Khajuraho group of temples, while built together, were dedicated to two religions, Hinduism and Jainism, suggesting a tradition of acceptance and respect for diverse religious views among Hindus and Jains in the region.</p>
                    <p><b>KHAJURAHO HISTORY</b><br/>
                    The Hindu and Jain temple complex at Khajuraho in central India has become a major tourist site for Indians and International tourists. Built nearly a thousand years ago, but abandoned two centuries later, Khajuraho remained a minor pilgrimage site into the present century. The Khajuraho temples include thousands of sexual relief carvings, much publicized throughout India. Khajuraho temples were built during the Chandela period, a dynasty which survived for five centuries before falling to the onslaught of Islam. The history tells us that in ancient India, the kings did not sponsor directly the making of rock-cut caves, stupas or temples. None of the stupas have sculptures of the Kings and rulers of those times. But with the arrival of the medieval period, rulers began to patronize personally the making of temples. The personal attention of the ruler led to the making of the larger temples, especially from the 10th or 11th century onwards, under the Cholas in south India. Similarly, changes were seen under the rule of the Chandela in central India. Chandela dynasty was well established and there was peace and prosperity in 10th and 11th century. Art and culture flourished there as the kings were great patrons of poetry and theatre. The symbol of their cultural achievements was at their capital city of Khajuraho, where between the 10th and 12th centuries, one of the most splendid temple cities in the history of the world was created. There were originally 85 temples created, out of which only 22 are remain today. The first king who started construction in Khajuraho was Harsh who built the 64 Yogini Temples.</p>
